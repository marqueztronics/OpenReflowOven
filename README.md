# Open Reflow Oven

A reflow oven controller to be used with regular electric toaster ovens.

PCB designed in Altium CircuitStudio.

Current status: Finished v0.1 PCB layout. Nothing tested so far.

Note: If you are looking for schematics, Gerber, BOM, etc. they are under the "Default Configuration" folder. Circuit Studio has a weird directory structure.
